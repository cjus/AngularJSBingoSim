# AngularJS BINGO Simulator
This app is a simulation of the classic game BINGO. I built it to demonstrate the use of the following AngularJS concepts:

* Angular controllers, models, data binding

* Angular templates, ng-repeat

* Dependency injection

* Angular Services as a way of creating reusable libraries

* Use of Bootstraps grid system to layout a BINGO card
